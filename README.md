Financial Reporting – Interactive Course Materials

This repository hosts the interactive web-based materials for the Financial Reporting course (MBUS 629). The platform is designed to provide students with guided walkthroughs, hands-on simulations, and applied analysis projects.

Project Structure

The application is organized into four main learning pillars:

Interactive Slides: Guided, slide-based walkthroughs for in-class discussion and conceptual scaffolding.

Exercise Simulations: Hands-on accounting exercises covering transactions, articulation, and financial analysis.

Review Simulations: Applied, company-based analysis and exam-style reasoning cases to consolidate learning.

Ongoing Analysis Project (OAP): A cumulative project analyzing real company financial statements using structured frameworks.

Review Simulations

The Review Simulations section (/review-simulations) is styled with an Indigo/Violet theme to distinguish it from the instructional content. It focuses on consolidating knowledge through targeted review cases.

Available Modules

Module 3: Financial statement analysis and operating performance review.

Module 4: Credit analysis, risk assessment, and balance sheet interpretation.

Module 6: Inventory, PPE, and long-lived asset analysis.

Roadmap (Coming Soon)

Module 5: Revenue recognition and operating income analysis.

Module 7: Liabilities, debt structure, and off-balance sheet financing.

Technical Details

Stack: Plain HTML5 & CSS3 (Zero-dependency, no build step required).

Design System: Uses CSS variables for consistent theming across different sections (Teal for Exercises/OAP, Indigo for Reviews, Blue for Slides).
